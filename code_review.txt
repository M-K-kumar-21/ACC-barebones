Here is an analysis of the Python code provided:

1. Potential Issues:
   - The method of fetching the variables `x` and `y` is insecure and may cause issues. If the module `variables` does not exist or does not contain the variables `x` and `y`, it will show an `ImportError` or `AttributeError`.
   - This method does not handle unexpected cases, like if `x` or `y` are not integers.
   - Logging/printing any unprocessed user-provided data is a security risk. If the variables contain sensitive data and your application logs this output, it could potentially expose sensitive information.

2. Optimization Suggestions:
   - Add logic to check for existence of `variables` to handle import errors.
   - Use `try` and `except` blocks to handle exceptions/errors. Check if `x` and `y` are numbers before adding them.
   - Use lazy logging to avoid unnecessary computations.

3. Best Practices:
   - Code should adhere to PEP 8 standards guide for formatting. Ensure appropriate spacing and appropriate use of line lengths.
   - Do not print out possibly sensitive data in your logs/console.
   - Include Docstrings for larger scripts to make your project more maintainable.

4. Error Handling:
   - Use `try` and `except` blocks to gracefully handle any exceptions the code may encounter.
   - You could set default values for `x` and `y` in case they are not defined.

5. Security Considerations:
   - Always escape user-generated inputs to prevent injection attacks.
   - Do not print out sensitive data.

The updated code according to suggestions would be something like:

```python
import logging

try:
    import variables
    x = getattr(variables, 'x', 0)
    y = getattr(variables, 'y', 0)

    if isinstance(x, (int, float)) and isinstance(y, (int, float)):
        logging.info("sum = %s", x+y)
    else:
        logging.error("Variables x and y need to be numbers.")
except ImportError:
    logging.error("Module 'variables' does not exist.")
except Exception as e:
    logging.error("Caught an error: " + str(e))
```

Remember, the security and validation of the variables `x` and `y` should be taken care at source, where these are being set or inputted.

The given Python code snippet isn't much to analyze as it's just assigning two integer values to the variables 'x' and 'y'. However, let's address each of your points:

1. **Potential Issues**: There shouldn't be any issues with this code snippet as it just assigns static integer values to 'x' and 'y'. We assume that these variables will be used somewhere else in the code.

2. **Performance Optimizations**: This code already runs in constant time O(1), meaning the execution time doesn't depend on the size of input, so there's no direct way to optimize this any further. 

3. **Deviations from Best Practices**: It's hard to discuss this without additional context. The variable names 'x' and 'y' are very generic. Best practice would be to use more descriptive variable names that represent what the values are being used for in your program. This approach makes the code more readable and maintainable. For example, instead of 'x', we could have 'numEmployees', 'totalSalary', etc, depending on the problem we are trying to solve. 

4. **Error Handling**: As it stands, this code won't produce any errors. However, if the assignment was dynamic (coming from user input or a file) then there would be scope for error handling. For example, what if the user is expected to input a number and they input a string or an unrecognizable value? These are things you would want to add error handling for.

5. **Security Considerations**: This simple variable assignment does not pose any security risks. However, it's crucial to consider security when dealing with confidential or sensitive data – think passwords, user data, etc. Those aren't applicable here, so no specific security considerations need to be made for this tiny snippet.

In its full context, further recommendations might be made, but with just these two lines, this is the most comprehensive analysis possible.

1. Issues & Best Practices:

    i) Directly using the `print()` function on a calculation operation can be hazardous if the included variables aren't of proper data types (int or float). An exception will occur if the variables `x` and `y` are not numerical values or not defined at all in the module.

    ii) There's no error handling which means that program crashes if any unexpected situation occurs.

    iii) There's no comment/documentation to understand what actually the code is trying to do.

    iv) The imported module name ‘variables’ is generic. According to best practices, it should be something more specific and meaningful.

2. Optimizations for better performance:
   
   Optimizations are not obviously necessary for such a small script, but here's one small change:

    ```python
    # Compute the sum first, then print
    sum_value = variables.x+variables.y
    print("Sum =", sum_value)
    ```
    It may be somewhat helpful in terms of readability.

3. Suggestions for Error handling:

   It's better to handle errors with a `try/except` block.  

    ```python
    try:
        sum_value = variables.x + variables.y
        print("Sum =", sum_value)
    except TypeError:
        print("Error: Either variable x or variable y is not a number.")
    except AttributeError:
        print("Error: Either variable x or variable y is not defined.")
    ```

4. Security considerations:

   This script doesn't have immediate security vulnerabilities. However, when you import modules, make sure you trust their sources as they could contain malicious code. You should also ensure that input isn't being received from an untrusted source, particularly if the values of `x` and `y` aren't hardcoded, to prevent code injection attacks.

5. For maintainability, you may wish to consider good naming conventions and use descriptive variable names.
RepoCopy\variables.py
This is a very simple snippet of Python code which just assigns values to two variables. However, scrutinizing it in detail from different aspects:

1. Issues: 
No apparent issues can be spotted in the given code as it is only two lines of variable assignments.

2. Performance:
In these two lines of code, there are no performance heavy computations that require optimization. Thus, no changes are necessary for performance enhancement.

3. Best Practices:
Variable naming is an important part of coding best practices. The names `x` and `y` could be improved to better represent the data they are storing. Additionally, it's a good practice to add a comment explaining what the variables are for.

4. Error Handling:
For the existing code, no error handling is needed as there's no chance of an exception being raised by these operations under normal circumstances. 

5. Security:
The assigned values seem to be hard coded. If these values are sensitive (passwords, secret keys, etc.), then this is not a good practice. Sensitive data should never be hard coded in the source code. If these were sensitive data, they need to be stored securely or pulled from environment variables/or encrypted configuration files.

More complex code might warrant further discussions about error handling, security, performance optimization and best practices, but in these two lines of code, these are the only significant points to highlight.
